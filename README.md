# Module 4 - Virus Simulations

YOU WILL USE THIS REPOSITORY FOR BOTH WEEKS OF THIS MODULE.

---

### Instructions
- For the first week, create the `Point`, `Vector`, and `Cell` classes as outlined in the templates and pseudocode given to you in Canvas.
- Create a single simulation as described on the assignment page in Canvas. 
     - Sync your code to GitHub when you are done with creating the classes and the first simulation, but continue using the code you have written in this repository as you build additional simulations.

- For the second week, be sure that you have
     - 3 simulations that take data autonomously
     - 3 files of data from those simulations
     - 3 visualizations created from your data.

- When you are finished, be sure to sync (commit and push) your code to GitHub and create screencasts to turn in to Canvas.

### Tips
- Test your code. 
    - Find good stopping points to test out bits of code and
    functions even when your program is only partially finished. 
    - Try out different inputs and see if you expect the outputs that you get. Create your own history lists for this!
- Ask for help on Twist, or feel free to talk to your group members. 
    - Remember that we are traveling together on this 
    learning journey and you don't have to struggle alone!
    - It is way more important that you get your questions answered than it is
    for you to have a perfectly working program
- Try some [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).
    - Find a rubber duck, or a pet rock, a stuffed animal, a figurine, a patient dog.
    - Explain your program, line by line, to the victim of your choice.
    - Sometimes this helps you think through your code and how it works, and 
    can help you find bugs and errors in your code.
- DO NOT COPY/PASTE CODE unless otherwise instructed to.
    - The purpose of these exercises is for you to practice your programming skills.
    - You will only harm yourself if you do not make the effort to understand the
    programming concepts we are covering.
